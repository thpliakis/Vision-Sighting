# Vision-Sighting
  This is the third project of my Computer Graphics uiversity Course.

This project, in conjunction with the previous 2, creates a full framework of capturing a virtual scene. This project, in conjunction with the previous 2, creates a full framework of capturing a virtual scene. Given a set of triangles in a numpy array object the code calculates an image based of the position of the camera (World Coordinate System) , the light and the shading we want (Gouraud or Phong).

# Lighting and surface material functions
1. Ambient light
2. Diffuse light
3. Specular light

# Shadding
1. Calculate normals
2. Render object
3. Shade Gouraud
4. Shade Phong

# Run
python3 demo.py
